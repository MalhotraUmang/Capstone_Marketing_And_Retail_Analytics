# __Capstone: Marketing_And_Retail_Analytics__

## __Background and Problem Statement:__
OList, an e-commerce company has faced some losses recently and they want to reduce any unnecessary inventory costs.

To manage the inventory cost of the company OList, it is required to identify top products contributing to the revenue, identify items that are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products, identify the product categories which they can get rid of without significantly impacting business.

### In this capstone,
Only the cases having order status as '_delivered_' are considered.
EDA is performed to treat outliers and missing values carefully before making any inferences from the dataset.
